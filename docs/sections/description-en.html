The core concept is the SurveyElement representing a block in the flow of the overall survey. In the first version of the ontology we identified three main subtypes of blocks:Talk,Question and Answer. The flow of the survey among the different blocks is defined through the property leadsTo connecting subsequent SurveyElements.</br>

A Talk represents a textual message within the survey, it can be characterized by a simple text or a link to an external resource.</br>

A Question block is described by the textual description of the question and defines the typology of interaction required to the user. We identified the following hierarchy. Question has two main subclasses:OpenQuestion accepting an arbitrary answer from the user, and ClosedQuestion offering to the user a set of options to choose from. OpenQuestions can be SingleInputQuestion, or MultipleInputQuestion accepting more than one input from the user. ClosedQuestions can be CheckboxQuestion allowing the selection of more than one option from the user, or MultipleChoiceQuestion forcing the user to select a single option among the ones available. A MultipleChoiceQuestion is associated to one QuestionVisualization defining how the different options associated to the question should be visualized to the user. A list of predefined individuals for the QuestionVisualization class is instantiated in the ontology: Emoji, Option, Scale, Slider and Dropdown. To annotate questions with investigated variables, we defined specific concepts: the ObservableVariable class describes the direct variable measured by the question (e.g., feedback on catering at an event), the LatentVariableclass identifies the variable that can be indirectly measured considering the question (e.g., overall appreciation for the event). In general, each individual can be defined  as  an  instance  of  these  classes,  the  use  of  well-know  vocabularies  can help other researchers in searching, in a knowledge graph containing published surveys, the set of questions addressing the same latent/observable variables and asked in other related studies.</br>

Answer blocks are of two main subtypes: OpenAnswer blocks that can be associated only to OpenQuestions and describe the typology of input expected by the user, and ClosedAnswer blocks associated to ClosedQuestion blocks and characterizing the available options for each question. In the first version of the ontology we did not define sub-classes for OpenAnswer considering only generic textual values, but it can be further characterized to admit specific answers (e.g.,number, date, etc.) or special typologies of inputs (e.g., voice message, image). ClosedAnswer blocks  are  described  using  a  textual  label  (hasText)  shown  in the chat and an integer representing the intended visualization order (hasOrderNumber). Moreover, to annotate answers with their numerical coding we designed two data properties to associate a numeric value to the answer (hasValue) and/or an amount of points if the survey is used also with gamificationpurposes (hasPoints).</br></br>

The principal concept is the Survey class that is defined as a subclass of ResearchObject. Intuitively, a ResearchObject is an aggregation of Resources describing a scientific investigation. A Survey aggregates two main resources identified in the ontology: a SurveyProcedure, describing the survey structure, and a SurveyDataSet, containing collected answers. Moreover,  as a ResearchObject, it can aggregate other additional resources representing hypotheses of the study, models on variables investigated produced from the analysis of the results, publications related, etc.</br>
A SurveyProcedure describes the structure of the survey and it is defined as a subclass of Process since it represents the ”workflow” adopted in the research study to collect answers. A SurveyProcedure is connected to all the SurveyElements composing the survey, the first block is identified through the startsWith object property. Entities defining answers collected through a survey are modelled as structured data and tightly bounded to the survey structure. The SurveyCompletionTask class inherits fromProcessRun and refers to the Activity of executing a SurveyProcedure and, hence, completing the survey. A SurveyCompletionTask is characterized by a startedAtTime and endedAtTime properties, and can be associated with a SurveyTarget instance describing metadata on the survey completion (e.g., considering the same survey on feedback for a retail chain we may want to associate to each SurveyCompletionTask the store where the survey has been administered). A CompletedSurvey is the Artifact generated as result of a SurveyCompletionTask, and it is described by a set of CompletedQuestions representing the answers given by a specific user in a specific survey completion. Each CompletedQuestion is characterized by the  timestamp  in  which  the  answer  has  been collected, is linked to the the Question that has been answered and specifies the answer(s) given by the user. If the CompletedQuestion refers to a ClosedQuestion, then it is directly associated with the ClosedAnswer(s) selected by the user; if it refers to an OpenQuestion, then it is directly associated to the answer test through a specific data property. To handle provenance of answers collected, we defined the Participant class identifying the Agents associated with the SurveyCompletionTask, the resulting CompletedSurvey and the related CompletedQuestions. It is important to point out that a single Participant may compile the survey multiple times, thus having multiple SurveyCompletionTasks associated.</br>
A SurveyDataSet is a DataSet as defined in the RDF Data Cube vocabulary and collects all the CompletedQuestions (subclass of Observation) for a Survey. MultipleSurveyDataSet can be instantiated for the same SurveyProcedure if, for example, the same survey is executed multiple times in different ”waves”. A CompletedSurvey can be seen as a Slice of the SurveyDataSet collecting all the CompletedQuestions related to the same SurveyCompletionTask.</br></br>

The vann:usageNote annotation is used in the ontology to describe the intended usage of re-used classes and properties.
