<h2>Abstract</h2>
<span class="markdown">
Coney is an innovative survey instrument to enhance user engagement. It exploits a conversational approach, by administering questionnaires mimicking a chat. To implement FAIR principles, to pave the way for the adoption of Coney within Open Science and to promote responsible and reproducible research, we offer the graph-based model of Coney as an open ontological model; this allows to publish and to share on the web both the surveys and their collected answers as linked data research objects.
