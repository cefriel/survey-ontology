# Survey Ontology

Ontology for surveys based on the Coney data model. Published at [w3id.org/survey-ontology](https://w3id.org/survey-ontology). 

### Purpose and scope of the vocabulary

Coney is an innovative survey instrument to enhance user engagement. It exploits a conversational approach, by administering questionnaires mimicking a chat. To implement FAIR principles, to pave the way for the adoption of Coney within Open Science and to promote responsible and reproducible research, we offer the graph-based model of Coney as an open ontological model; this allows to publish and to share on the web both the surveys and their collected answers as linked data research objects.

The intended use of terms and their relations with referred ontologies are detailed in the [diagram](docs/ontology.png).

### Development phases

The material generated in the different activities carried out during the development of the vocabulary, use
cases, user stories, glossary of terms, etc., will be available in the [Vocabulary Wiki](#)
